The workshop dashboard consists of the workshop instructions on the left hand side, and a pair of terminals on the right hand side. All interaction with the Kubernetes cluster performed in the workshops uses the ``kubectl`` command line tool. To find out the version of Kubernetes being used, you can run:

```execute
kubectl version
```

Did you type the command in yourself? If you did, click on the command instead and you will find that it is executed for you. You can click on any command in the workshop instructions which has the <span class="fas fa-running"></span> icon shown to the right of it, and it will be copied to the appropriate interactive terminal and run. If you would rather make a copy of the command so you can paste it to another window, hold down the shift key when you click on the command.

Although ``kubectl`` will be used to execute commands against the Kubernetes cluster, the Kubernetes dashboard is also provided for exploring the cluster. This can be found by clicking on the **Console** tab.

If you want to end the workshop early, you can select **Restart Workshop** from the drop down menu on the right hand side.
